## 03 Setting values

In this example we'll create a class with scrolling menu that is able to do some value settings and see how to create/destruct menu objects.
Pls. use same enviroment as in example 01.

All examples are ready-to-build [Platformio](https://platformio.org/) projects. Pls switch to example folder and run `pio run -t upload && pio device monitor` to build for esp32-S2 board and `pio run -e esp32 -t upload && pio device monitor -e esp32` for generic ESP32.
Arduino IDE users should also be fine, but I have not tested it, sorry.
